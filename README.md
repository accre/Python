# Python

Scripts demonstrating how to run Python jobs on the 
ACCRE cluster. Each directory should contain at least
a Python script and SLURM script, and preferably a README.md
file providing details about the job, installation instructions,
etc.

Contributing New Examples
-------------------------

We encourage users to submit new examples of jobs they have
successfully run on the cluster. Instructions for submitting
new examples to this repository are provided here:
